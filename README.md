I left some instructions inside comments with the work i've already done and some explaination of what i've tried to do, But unfortunately, i was a little too hopeful, and i missed a few day to finish it the way i intended to do, But added a few things extra that i felt could be interesting for that kind of page. it was a pretty good experience, and i'm glad i got the chance to do those things :)
